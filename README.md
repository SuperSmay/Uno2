## How to use
1. First, [invite](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=736418090627235951&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands) the bot to your server.
2. To join a lobby, go the chat you want the game to be hosted in and type `/join`.
3. Once every player who wants to play is in the lobby, type `/start` to start the game.
4. The bot should begin DMing every player with a few game messages. This will take several seconds. The bot will tell you when the game has started.
5. When it is your turn to play, select a card from your hand and use the dot ⏺ to play it. If you cannot play a card, draw cards with the Uno card.
6. The first player to run out of cards wins the game!

### Controls
Use the arrows ◀ ▶ to cycle one card at a time through your hand, and use the double arrows ⏪ ⏩ to cycle two cards at a time through your hand. Use the dot ⏺ to play a card and the Uno card to draw cards. 

### Special cards
