Redo hand message. Ideas pinned in #testing-spam

player profiles
Async message sending for game startup
Async message edits maybe


BUGS:

Game embed shows channelID instead of name
Hand embed shows user tag id instead of name
/start reply should be deleted once the game starts
Other players card count shown as zero in dm message because the game message is sent before other players get their cards
