BUGS:
Jumping in with plus 4s sometimes gets the player state stuck in card and the plus 4 cannot be finished

Game embed shows channelID instead of name
Hand embed shows user tag id instead of name
/start reply should be deleted once the game starts
Other players card count shown as zero in dm message because the game message is sent before other players get their cards
