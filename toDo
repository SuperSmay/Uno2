Reverse/skips need to be fixed again
draw cards
stacks
7-0
jump in



player profiles
Async message sending for game startup


BUGS:

Game embed shows channelID instead of name
Hand embed shows user tag id instead of name
/start reply should be deleted once the game starts
wild card messages missing capitalization
Other players card count shown as zero in dm message because the game message is sent before other players get their cards


Fixed...?
