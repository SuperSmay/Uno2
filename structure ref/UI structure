Other - Implementation: When it is your turn the bot will send a message sayung such. Then when the turn is over it will update the message to a blank emote. If the user does an invalid action then update the message to say its not your turn for two seconds (to avoid new ping)
    "Its not your turn" messages that dissapear after a second or two
    "Its your turn" messages that dissapear when its not your turn and ping you when it is
